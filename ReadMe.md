# OpenCodeRAG

OpenCodeRAG is a **local-first RAG plugin** for semantic code search. It converts your codebase into vector indices and retrieves relevant code chunks on natural language queries. The primary aim is to save tokens by replacing full-file reads with targeted chunk retrieval and to speed-up tool calls for large codebases. Integrates seamlessly with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and works standalone via CLI. 

You don't need a dedicated GPU to run embedding LLMs, smaller models can still run performant on modern CPUs.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Don't confuse this with the npm package `opencode-rag` (a discontinued project by a different author).

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/your-org/OpenCodeRAG.git
cd OpenCodeRAG
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build
./install.sh                          # global install (optional)

# 2. Initialize in your project
cd /path/to/your/project
opencode-rag init

# 3. Index your workspace
opencode-rag index

# 4. Search
opencode-rag query "authentication middleware"
```

**Prerequisites:** Node.js v22+, [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) (default) or other LLM-hosters with installed embedding model (e.g. embeddinggemma).

## Agent Discovery

OpenCodeRAG registers tools that agents can invoke directly. Agents discover these tools via the OpenCode **skill system** - when `opencode-rag init` runs, it creates `.opencode/skills/opencode-rag/SKILL.md` which teaches agents the recommended workflow:

1. **Skeleton first** - `get_file_skeleton(filePath)` to orient in a file
2. **Find usages** - `find_usages(symbolName)` before editing any symbol
3. **Search** - `opencode-rag-context(query)` or `search_semantic(query)` to find relevant code
4. **Read** - use `read` on specific line ranges
5. **Edit** - make changes with full context

### Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `opencode-rag-context` | General-purpose code retrieval | Before any code task when you haven't read the relevant code |
| `search_semantic` | Conceptual code search | "How does X work?", "Where is Y?" |
| `get_file_skeleton` | Quick file overview via AST | Before reading a large file to decide which sections matter |
| `find_usages` | Symbol reference search | **Before editing** any function, variable, or class |
| `read` (optional) | RAG-enhanced file read | Full file contents with supplementary context chunks |

## OpenCode Integration

When using OpenCode, the plugin enhances your agent with three discovery mechanisms:

### 1. Skill-Based Discovery (Recommended)
`opencode-rag init` creates `.opencode/skills/opencode-rag/SKILL.md` - an OpenCode skill that teaches agents the tool workflow. Agents load it on demand via the `skill` tool, keeping token overhead minimal.

### 2. Auto-Injection (Background Context)
After every message you send, the plugin searches your vector-indexed codebase:
- **High-confidence results (score ≥ 0.75):** Actual code chunks are injected directly into your prompt, giving the agent instant context without a tool-call round-trip.
- **Lower-confidence results:** A compact list of suggested files is appended instead (e.g., `src/plugin.ts (lines 10-42)`).

### 3. System Prompt Guidance (Conditional)
When chunks are indexed, a brief tool list is prepended to the system prompt so agents know the tools exist. This is skipped when no chunks are indexed to save tokens.

## Privacy & Security

**100% local by default.** Embeddings are generated locally via Ollama. The vector database stays in your project directory. **No source code or embeddings leave your machine** unless you explicitly configure a third-party API.
